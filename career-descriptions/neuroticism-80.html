        Your <strong>Neuroticism score is 80â€“100%</strong>, suggesting that you
        experience high emotional sensitivity and may be prone to stress,
        anxiety, or emotional fluctuations. You are deeply attuned to your
        emotions, and while this can make you highly empathetic, it may also
        lead to periods of emotional overwhelm or difficulty in managing stress.
        You may have a tendency to worry or become anxious in high-pressure
        situations.
