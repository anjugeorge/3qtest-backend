        Your <strong>Openness score is 20–40%</strong>, which means you prefer
        familiarity, structure, and practicality. You tend to value routines,
        tradition, and real-world experience more than abstract ideas or
        imaginative thinking. You are reliable and grounded — someone who finds
        comfort in clarity and consistency.
