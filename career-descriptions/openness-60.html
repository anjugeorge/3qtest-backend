        ways. You're open to growth and innovation, but you also appreciate
        structure and real-world results.

          the imagination to dream big, and the practicality to turn vision into
          value. Look for careers where innovation is encouraged, but where
          outcomes matter too. You’re a natural connector of ideas and action.
