        Your <strong>Social RIASEC score is 0–20%</strong>, indicating that you
        are highly introverted in social contexts and prefer to support others
        quietly. You find energy in working independently and contribute best
        behind the scenes. You value meaningful connections, but social
        interaction can feel draining if it’s too frequent or intense.

        you can focus on helping others or completing tasks without constant
        social demands. Small teams or solitary roles allow you to make a
        meaningful impact quietly.
