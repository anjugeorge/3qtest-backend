        You flourish in
        <strong>structured, hands-on, and technical environments</strong>. You
        value practicality, efficiency, and clear processes. Careers that allow
        you to work directly with tools, machines, or real-world problems will
        bring out your strengths. Highly abstract or purely theoretical work may
        feel less engaging.
