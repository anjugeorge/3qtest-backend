        You thrive in
        <strong>stable and well-structured environments</strong> that allow for
        a balanced approach to challenges. While you can handle stress and
        pressure, you prefer roles where the pace is steady, and the
        expectations are clear. A moderate level of emotional demands is
        suitable for you, as long as you have time to recharge and maintain
        equilibrium.
