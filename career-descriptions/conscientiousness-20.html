        Your <strong>Social RIASEC score is 20–40%</strong>, indicating that you
        are more reserved in social situations. You prefer to help and support
        others quietly, valuing meaningful interactions over constant
        engagement. You work best when you can contribute in a focused,
        thoughtful way without being in the spotlight.

        social contributions without excess pressure.
