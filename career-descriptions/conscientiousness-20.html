        Your <strong>Conscientiousness score is 20–40%</strong>, indicating that
        you prefer a flexible, free-flowing approach to life and work. You
        dislike rigid routines and thrive when you can follow your instincts and
        creativity. Planning and structure aren’t your priorities — innovation

        you're free to express yourself and explore new ideas. Rules and
        schedules can feel restrictive, so flexibility and autonomy are key for
        your success.

          <strong>Final Insight:</strong> Your ability to think outside the box

          roles that allow room for improvisation, passion-driven work, and
          unconventional ideas. You were made to break the mold — not live
          inside it.
