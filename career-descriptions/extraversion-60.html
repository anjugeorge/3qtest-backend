        Your <strong>Extraversion score is 60–80%</strong>, which shows that you
        are a social and energetic person, but you also enjoy your personal
        space and time to reflect. You thrive in environments where you can
        interact with others, but you're equally comfortable working
        independently when needed. You strike a perfect balance between engaging
        with others and recharging on your own.
