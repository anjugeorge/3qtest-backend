      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px">
        You are naturally reserved and tend to avoid the spotlight. You may find
        social events draining, preferring quiet, solitary environments where
        you can focus on personal pursuits. Your strength lies in your ability
        to think deeply, reflect, and be self-reliant. While you may not seek
        out frequent social interactions, you are very loyal to the close
        relationships you do form.

          <strong>Final Insight:</strong> You are a quiet and introspective
          individual who values time alone to reflect and recharge. While you
          may not actively seek out social situations, your ability to form
          deep, meaningful relationships with a select few makes you a valued
          friend and colleague. Seek roles that allow you to work independently
          or in small, focused teams.
