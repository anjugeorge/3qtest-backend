        Your <strong>Neuroticism score is 60â€“80%</strong>, indicating that you
        are emotionally sensitive and often experience fluctuations in mood or
        anxiety. While you may handle stress better than individuals with higher
        scores, you still tend to worry about potential issues or outcomes. Your
        sensitivity helps you tune into the emotional state of those around you,
        but it can also make you susceptible to feeling overwhelmed at times.

        Personality Traits:

      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px">
        You are emotionally aware, which allows you to recognize and process
        your emotions effectively. However, you can sometimes become overly
        sensitive, especially in stressful situations. You are likely to be more
        cautious and reflective about potential risks, and your anxiety can
        sometimes make you question outcomes or decisions. While you are capable
        of handling pressure, there are moments when your sensitivity may impact
        your performance.
