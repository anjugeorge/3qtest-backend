        Your <strong>Agreeableness score is 0â€“20%</strong>, indicating that you
        are highly independent, direct, and self-reliant. You tend to prioritize
        your own goals, preferences, and perspectives above the needs of others.
        You may find it challenging to align with group norms or engage in
        social pleasantries, and you prefer to work alone or in roles where you
        are in control.

        You tend to be assertive, self-sufficient, and prefer to follow your own
        path. Social harmony and diplomacy are less important to you, and you
        may come across as blunt or even confrontational at times. Your primary
        focus is on achieving your own goals and maintaining your independence.

          <strong>Final Insight:</strong> Your independence and assertiveness
          make you a strong-willed and determined individual. You thrive in
          environments where you can work alone, take charge, and pursue your
          own objectives without being constrained by group expectations. Seek
          roles where you have autonomy, where your direct approach is valued,
          and where you can lead with confidence. While your blunt style may not
          always be appreciated in social settings, your ability to cut through
          the noise and focus on what matters will allow you to succeed in
          environments that prioritize results over diplomacy.
