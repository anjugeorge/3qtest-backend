        Your <strong>Neuroticism score is 80â€“100%</strong>, suggesting that you
        experience high emotional sensitivity and may be prone to stress,
        anxiety, or emotional fluctuations. You are deeply attuned to your
        emotions, and while this can make you highly empathetic, it may also
        lead to periods of emotional overwhelm or difficulty in managing stress.
        You may have a tendency to worry or become anxious in high-pressure
        situations.

      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px">
        You are emotionally sensitive, which means you experience intense
        emotions, both positive and negative. Your heightened awareness of your
        feelings can make you more empathetic and understanding toward others,
        but it may also lead to feeling overwhelmed during stressful or
        uncertain times. You tend to worry about potential outcomes and often
        feel the weight of pressure in challenging situations.

          <strong>Final Insight:</strong> Your sensitivity and emotional depth
          can be both a strength and a challenge. You are uniquely attuned to
          the emotional landscape around you, which makes you an excellent
          support system for others. However, it's important to create a work
          and personal environment that offers emotional stability and support
          to prevent burnout. Strive for balance and seek roles that provide
          structure, clarity, and the opportunity to manage your emotional
          well-being.
