        Your <strong>Extraversion score is 0â€“20%</strong>, indicating that you
        are highly reserved and introverted. You prefer solitude or spending
        time with a small, close-knit group of people. Large social gatherings
        can feel overwhelming, and you find peace and energy in quiet, private
        settings. You are introspective, thoughtful, and often engage in
        activities that allow for deep reflection.

      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 10px">
        You are the epitome of introspection and solitude. Social interactions,
        especially in larger groups, often drain your energy, and you prefer
        activities that allow you to think and process things quietly. You enjoy
        exploring ideas and hobbies independently, often avoiding the limelight
        in favor of personal space and reflection.

          <strong>Final Insight:</strong> You are a quiet and introspective
          individual who finds strength and inspiration in solitude. While large
          social interactions may not appeal to you, your ability to think
          deeply, work independently, and form close relationships with a few
          select people are your strengths. Seek roles that allow you to work
          alone or with a small, focused team where your reflective nature can
          thrive.
