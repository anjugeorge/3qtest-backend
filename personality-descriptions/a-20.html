        prioritize your own views, needs, and personal space. You value

        others' emotions or opinions.

        consensus. While you may not shy away from conflict, you prefer to
        engage in direct, straightforward communication rather than tiptoeing
        around sensitive topics. Your independence and self-reliance are key
        characteristics that drive your decisions and actions.
